    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball of pizza dough (about 12 inches in diameter)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (preferably homemade or high-quality store-bought)</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically between 475째F (245째C) and 500째F (260째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven at this time.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, stretch the pizza dough out to about 12 inches in diameter, then transfer it to a piece of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange the slices of fresh mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Scatter fresh basil leaves over the cheese. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza (with the parchment paper) to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then cut into slices. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
