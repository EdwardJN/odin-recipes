    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Italian lasagna is a sumptuous, layered dish that begins with the preparation of its foundational components: a hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and al dente pasta sheets. The meat sauce, known as ragù, is a savory blend of ground beef (or a mix of beef and pork for added depth), sautéed onions, garlic, and carrots, simmered slowly with crushed tomatoes, basil, and a splash of red wine, creating a rich and flavorful base. The béchamel sauce, a smooth, white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, is seasoned with a pinch of nutmeg for warmth. Pre-cooked lasagna sheets, either fresh or dried, are prepared to be just tender, ready to soak up the flavors of the sauces.</p>
    <p>To assemble the lasagna, a layer of meat sauce is spread at the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of pasta sheets. These layers are then topped with a generous spread of béchamel sauce and sprinkled with grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese for a gooey, cheesy pull. The process is repeated, building up layers until the dish is nearly full, finishing with a top layer rich in béchamel and cheese. The lasagna is baked until the top is golden and bubbly, and the flavors have melded together, creating a comforting, indulgent dish that is a hallmark of Italian cuisine. Once removed from the oven, the lasagna is allowed to rest, ensuring each slice holds its shape, offering a perfect balance of textures and flavors with every bite.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Heat the Olive Oil:</em> In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, garlic, carrot, and celery (if using). Sauté until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li><em>Brown the Meat:</em> Add the ground beef (and pork, if using) to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is thoroughly browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li><em>Add Wine and Tomatoes:</em> Pour in the red wine and add the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li><em>Season:</em> Add the oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Stir well.</li>
                <li><em>Simmer:</em> Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Remove the bay leaf and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Melt Butter:</em> In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li><em>Add Flour:</em>Whisk in the flour and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, without letting it brown.</li>
                <li><em>Add Milk:</em> Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li><em>Season:</em> Add a pinch of nutmeg and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
                </li>
            </ol> 
        <li><h3>Prepare the Lasagna Noodles:</h3></li>
            <p>If using traditional lasagna noodles, cook them in boiling salted water until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside on a clean towel. If using no-boil lasagna noodles, you can skip this step.</p>
        <li><h3>Assemble the Lasagna:</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Preheat Oven:</em> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li><em>First Layer:</em> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
                <li><em>Layering:</em> Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, then sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat the layers (meat sauce, noodles, béchamel, cheeses) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of béchamel and cheeses.</li>
                <li><em>Bake:</em> Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li><em>Rest:</em> Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Serve:</h3></li>
            <p>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and serve warm.</p>
    </ol>
